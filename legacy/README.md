# Legacy examples

This folder contains either:
- _Legacy_ examples compatible with older versions of GoRouter and Riverpod
- _Opinionated_ examples that were suggested by the community in the past, and such examples turned out to be less scalable or appreciated by the community itself

If you've never seen a GoRouter + Riverpod example, I'd suggest using the main folder examples.
