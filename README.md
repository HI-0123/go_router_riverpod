# go_router_example

A simple login / logout examples that showcases the use of [Riverpod] with [GoRouter].
These examples are community driven and strive to represent most of the solutions our community have found.
Feel free to create PR to introduce more examples.

**NOTE.** After the GoRouter v5 changes, combined with Riverpod v2, I strongly reccomend to check out the complex example in `./lib/others/async/complex_async_router.dart` if you're looking after a non-trivial implementation

Please consider starring this mini-repo if you found it useful. If you didn't, or if you want to contribute in any way, a discussion about improving this example can be found [here].
