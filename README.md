# Go Router + Riverpod Examples

This repo contains a plethora of examples on how to integrate [GoRouter] and [Riverpod] altogether.

These examples are community driven and strive to represent the "best" solution we've found.
Every example in here is a simple mock of a login.

## Special Thanks
**BIG THANKS** to...
- @[anyone] who has ever contributed in here
- @[the whole riverpod discord community] for the discussions we've enjoyed around this problem
- @rrousselGit for creating this _great_ ecosystem!

## Which example should I read or use?

I do realize there are _a lot_ of examples on this repo.

After putting a lot of thought, here's a quick guide to help you choose.

1. Check the `complete_example` folder for a full example containing the latest versions of riverpod and go router.
2. Check the `code_gen` for the same example as `complete_example`, but with the usage of `riverpod_annotation`, `freezed` and `go_router_builder`.
3. Check the `firebase_example` for a basic firebase integration with the two libraries.
4. Check the `legacy` folder for older, and possibly simpler examples. These examples are "old", but could still be useful. Some are to be discarded entirely, though (WIP).

## Something feels off....
