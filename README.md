# Go Router + Riverpod Examples

This repo contains a plethora of examples on how to integrate [GoRouter] and [Riverpod] altogether.
These examples are community driven and strive to represent most of the solutions the community have found.

Every example in here is a simple mock of a login / logout logic. Feel free to create PR to introduce more examples.


**NOTE.** It is strongly encouraged to avoid the `legacy` examples.

## Special Thanks
**BIG THANKS** to @creativecreatorormaybenot for introducing a clever, yet simple way of handling GoRouter with Riverpod. Its contributions made possible to simplify (a lot!) the updated examples.

(legacy examples are still being showcased in a dedicated folder, as a migration steps for whoever)

Please consider starring this mini-repo if you found it useful. If you didn't, or if you want to contribute in any way, a discussion about improving this example can be found [here].
