# Go Router + Riverpod Examples

This repo contains a plethora of examples on how to integrate [GoRouter] and [Riverpod] altogether.
Code generation is now implemented extensively.

These examples are community driven and strive to represent the "best" solution we've found.
Every example in here is a simple mock of a login.

## Special Thanks
**BIG THANKS** to @creativecreatorormaybenot for its previous suggestions.
**BIG THANKS** to @rrousselGit for creating this _great_ ecosystem!

## Which example should I read or use?
I do realize there are _a lot_ of examples on this repo. After the last changes, just read `complete_example` for a full example containing riverpod's code gen, riverpod's v2, freezed and go router's builder tools.

`legacy` examples are old, but could still be useful. Some are to be discarded entirely, though. WIP.

## Something feels off....
Please consider starring this mini-repo if you found it useful. If you didn't, or if you want to contribute in any way, a discussion about improving this example can be found [here].
